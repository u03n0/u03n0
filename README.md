## Oh ... You found me.
Welcome welcome. Nothing fancy here, just a snapshot into my mind, ambitions, broken dreams, good intentions and a few completed projects. Emphasis on *a few*.
### Goal of my repos
Just think of it as me thinking out loud. I reinforce what I know by doing (demonstrating). Nothing is particulary practical, novel nor impressive but helps me retain my understanding on various subjects.
A few repos were made from a shower-moment or 3am idea, and could become something real. So, **patent pending!**

## Languages:
- Ah `C++` my first. Fond memories, tough, challenging, but holds a special place in my heart. I wont forget our early times in the classroom, and laying on my bed kicking my feet in air, trying to figure you out.
- `Python`, my bread and butter. You've paid the rent. * pats shoulder in admiration and approval *
- Eh, and out of a lost sense of trying to be *different* (picked up at my last gig), there's none other than `Haskell`. 

## Domains
### Machine Learning:
If we can be specific; Natural Language Processing.
### ML Compilers
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... CUDA programming. Dusting off my C++ skills.

### New favorite tech quote: "everything is open source if you can reverse engineer" -LowLevel
Going back to the bane of my existence when I was taking CS courses ... Assembly x86. Why? I've got too much time on my hands ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜“

## Looking for:
Fellow DS, MLE who want to work on optimization, maybe NLP in particular, and of course anyone else who is interested in ML compilers.

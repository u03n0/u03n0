## Oh ... You found me.
Welcome welcome. Nothing fancy here, just a snapshot into my mind, ambitions, broken dreams, good intentions and a few completed projects. Emphasis on *a few*.
Most repos aim to explain a topic, with a Feynman apporach, while others showcase a micro project from end-to-end.

## Domains
### Machine Learning:
If we can be specific; Natural Language Processing.
### ML Compilers
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... CUDA programming. Dusting off my C++ skills.
### Languages:
The majority of repos will be in Python (jupyternotebooks for demonstrative purposes) however, I'm making a concerted effort to also have my repos be in C++.
Ocassionally I flirt with Haskell, but its more of an admired language than a practical one.

### New favorite tech quote: "everything is open source if you can reverse engineer" -LowLevel
Going back to the bane of my existence when I was taking CS courses ... Assembly x86.

## Looking to:
Collaborate on projects related in NLP but open to various topics.
